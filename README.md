This is a Bachelor Semester Project for my fifth Semester.
Secondary Language: German

## Introduction
The goal of the project is to analyze the PKEX protocol and trying to find
improvements. 

The first incrementation of the project is an implementation for the draft of
PKEX created by Dan Harkins \[1\]. For the authentication phase of the protocol
SPAKE2 is used. Here we use the implementation "python-spake2" of Warner \[2\].
The implementation is than modified according to the reveal phase of PKEX.
